# RollForLoot

Roll for Loot is use in combination with in game Master Loot to speed up the process of doing /roll based loot distribution. It is intended to be use by entire raid teams who want to implement their own loot systems that are based on doing in game /roll. This addon automatically comes alive when you convert to raid, and have a master loot loot an item greater than or equal to the configured threshold. Typically this threshold is set at Epic by most raid teams.

This add-on allows all rolls to be done in parallel and greatly increase the loot distribution efficiency of the distribution process. All raid team members must have a copy of the add-on.
